# Swordplay
Code for solving (and more importantly examining) a mathematical problem described in the readme


There are 1000 people standing in a circle (the given problem said 1000 Harvard students, hence the name of the class)
Each of these students is attempting to secure some prestigious position, job, award...
Here is how the winner is decided

Person 1 is given a sword.
In sequence, the person with the sword kill the person to his or her right, and passes the sword to the next person.
The last person standing wins.

For example, the 5 case:
(number with a trailing period has the sword)

1. 2 3 4 5 => 1 3 5. => 3. 5 => 3
   
in this case, 3 is the winner.
